The origins of anekantavada can be traced back to the teachings of Mahavira (599-527 BCE), the 24th Jain {IAST|Tirthankara}. Mallisena uses the parable to argue that immature people deny various aspects of truth; deluded by the aspects they do understand, they deny the aspects they don't understand. Nayavada is a compound of two Sanskrit words-naya (""partial viewpoint"") and vada (""school of thought or debate""). This means recognizing all aspects of reality, not merely one or some aspects, as is done in non-Jain philosophies."""
