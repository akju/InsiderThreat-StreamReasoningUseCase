This directory is an indispensible directory. The system will create 4 files:
* text1.txt
* text2.txt
* text3.txt 
* different-individuals.ttl. 
The first three files will be merged into the last one, which will be utilized during the data exifltration event reasoning process. 

text1.txt and text2.txt will be constantly updated as a suspicious action is detected. The main purpose to have this directory is to explicitly declare that all detected suspicious actions are different from each other, which is a required premise for data exfiltration event reasoning.

This action difference axiom is generated on the fly and cannot be pre-included in the ontology, which explains why and what the system is doing in this directory.
