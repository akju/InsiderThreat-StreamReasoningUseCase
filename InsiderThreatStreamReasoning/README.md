# Install
1. install stardog (I used stardog4.0-rc3)
2. create a database called db, make sure to set it as DL reasoning, as well as use "admin" as your both default username and password. Also make sure to enable "querying across the graphs".
3. install ant
4. download/unzip all the tar.gz file in data/streaming1user, data/streaming10user, data/streaming100user, data/streaming1000user.
5. in your terminal, cd to this directory and type "ant"
6. this code runs with Java 1.7 (probably is OK with java 1.8 but not tested)
