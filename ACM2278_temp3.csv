The comet was first named in Halley's honour by French astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille in 1759. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (those with low boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus.
